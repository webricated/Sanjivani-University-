<h1>Structured Interview – Scenario Based Questions</h1>

<!-- COMMUNICATION -->
<h2>1. Communication (5 Marks)</h2>

<div class="question">
Q1. Scenario: You strongly disagree with your tech lead’s approach, but the deadline is tight. How would you communicate your concern?
</div>
<div class="answer">
I would first ensure I fully understand the reasoning behind the tech lead’s approach instead of reacting emotionally.
Then I would clearly and concisely explain my concern using facts, data, or a small example to show the potential risk.
I would also propose an alternative solution along with its trade-offs, so it doesn’t sound like criticism.
If the tech lead still prefers their approach, I would respect the final decision, align with the team, and focus on execution while documenting risks if needed.

Q2. Explain a complex technical concept to a non-technical stakeholder who is blocking the project due to confusion.
</div>
<div class="answer">
I would avoid technical jargon completely and start with the business problem and impact.
Then I would use a simple real-world analogy related to their domain to explain the concept.
I would keep the explanation short, check their understanding by asking them to paraphrase it, and clarify any confusion.
The goal would be alignment and trust, not showing technical depth.
